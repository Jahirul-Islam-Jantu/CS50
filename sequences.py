# The Sequences is like the methods of string like we worked at JavaScript

name = "Jahir"
# print(name[0])
# It will print the first character of the string 
print(name[3])
# Like every programming languages python also starts counting from index zero. so the 3 number index will print the character 4


# List is like an array in JavaScript
names = ["Jahir", "Raihan", "Rahat", "Rakib"]
print(names[0])
# It will print the first element of the list
print(names[2])
# It will print the third element of the list
print(names)
# It will print the whole list


coordinateX = 10.0
coordinateY = 20.0
# coordinate = (coordinateX, coordinateY)
coordinate = (10.0, 20.0)
print(coordinate)

#  Data Structures

# List
# List is mutable
# We can change the value of a list
# We can add or remove any element from a list

# Tuple
# Tuple is like a list but it is immutable
# It is like a constant array
# We can't change the value of a tuple
# We can't add or remove any element from a tuple

# Set
# Set is like a list but it is unordered
# We can't access the element of a set by index
# We can't have duplicate elements in a set
# We can't have a list or dictionary in a set
# We can't have a set in a set
# We can't have a tuple in a set
# We can have a string in a set
# We can have a number in a set
# We can have a boolean in a set
# We can have a float in a set
# Set - Collection of Unique Elements


# Set doesn't keep elements in particular order where list and tuple does
# Set doesn't allow duplicate elements where list and tuple does

# Dictionary - Key Value Pair called (dict)
# Dictionary is mutable
# Dictionary is like a list but it has key value pair
# Dictionary is like a object in JavaScript
