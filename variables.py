# Python has a special prompt system called "input" it will take a value from the user and returns 
# myName variable will store a value from user, and print function will concat the name with the given string.
name = input("Name: ")
# This is a older string concat method used in python
# print("Hello " + myName) 
print(f"Hello, {name}")
# This is a new version of string concat method in python, this is like template literal in JavaScript
