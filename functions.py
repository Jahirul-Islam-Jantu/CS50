#  Simple structure of a function:

# def square():
#     return print("Hello World")

# square()
#  This is the basic structure of a function in python.

def square(x):
    return x * x
for i in range(1, 10):
    print(f"The square of {i} is {square(i)}")

#  This is the basic structure of a function with a parameter in python. and we are calling the function with a loop to print the square of the numbers from 1 to 9.
